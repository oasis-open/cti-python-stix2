# Experimenting with the Neo4j graph database Python STIX DataStore

The Neo4j graph database Python STIX DataStore is a proof-of-concept implementation to show how to store STIX content in a graph database. 

## Limitations:

 As a proof-of-concept it is mininal in its functionality.  
 
## Installing Neo4j

## Installing Neo4j python library

## Implementation Details

We would like to that the folks at JHU/APL for their implementation of [STIX2NEO4J.py](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/oca-iob/tree/main/STIX2NEO4J%20Converter), which this code is based on.
