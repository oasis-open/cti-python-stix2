def graphically_equivalent(ds1, ds2, prop_scores={}, **weight_dict):
    """This method verifies if two graphs are semantically equivalent.
    Each DataStore can contain a connected or disconnected graph and the
    final result is weighted over the amount of objects we managed to compare.
    This approach builds on top of the object-based semantic equivalence process
    and each comparison can return a value between 0 and 100.

    Args:
        ds1: A DataStore object instance representing your graph
        ds2: A DataStore object instance representing your graph
        prop_scores: A dictionary that can hold individual property scores,
            weights, contributing score, matching score and sum of weights.
        weight_dict: A dictionary that can be used to override settings
            in the semantic equivalence process

    Returns:
        float: A number between 0.0 and 100.0 as a measurement of equivalence.

    Warning:
        Object types need to have property weights defined for the equivalence process.
        Otherwise, those objects will not influence the final score. The WEIGHTS
        dictionary under `stix2.equivalence.graph` can give you an idea on how to add
        new entries and pass them via the `weight_dict` argument. Similarly, the values
        or methods can be fine tuned for a particular use case.

    Note:
        Default weights_dict:

        .. include:: ../default_sem_eq_weights.rst

    Note:
        This implementation follows the Semantic Equivalence Committee Note.
        see `the Committee Note <link here>`__.
